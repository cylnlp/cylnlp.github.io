I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Cambridge, working on automatic fact-checking with Professor [Andreas Vlachos](http://andreasvlachos.github.io). Before moving to Cambridge, I obtained my D.Phil. degree from Zhejiang University in 2023, advised by Professor [Yue Zhang](https://frcchang.github.io/), working on dialogue summarisation. I obtained my M.Sc. degree from the University of Edinburgh in 2018, advised by Professor [Bonnie Webber](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/bonnie/), working on event relation extraction. I obtained my B.Eng. degree from Wuhan University.

During my doctoral and master studies, I had the fortune to collaborate with excellent researchers, including Dr. <a href="https://nlp-yang.github.io/" style="color: rgb(203, 157, 255);">Yang Liu</a>, Dr. <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~cgzhu/">Chenguang Zhu</a>, Dr. <a href="https://ziyi-yang.github.io/">Ziyi Yang</a>, and Professor 

If you have any interests in collaborating with me, please drop me an email.

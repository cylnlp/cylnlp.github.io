I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Cambridge, working on automatic fact-checking with Professor <a href="http://andreasvlachos.github.io" style="color: rgb(203, 157, 255);">Andreas Vlachos</a>. Before moving to Cambridge, I obtained my D.Phil. degree from Zhejiang University in 2023, advised by Professor <a href="https://frcchang.github.io/" style="color: rgb(203, 157, 255);">Yue Zhang</a>, working on dialogue summarisation. I obtained my M.Sc. degree from the University of Edinburgh in 2018, advised by Professor <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/bonnie/" style="color: rgb(203, 157, 255);">Bonnie Webber</a>, working on event relation extraction. I obtained my B.Eng. degree from Wuhan University.

During my doctoral and master studies, I had the fortune to collaborate with excellent researchers, including Dr. <a href="https://nlp-yang.github.io/" style="color: rgb(203, 157, 255);">Yang Liu</a>, Dr. <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~cgzhu/" style="color: rgb(203, 157, 255);">Chenguang Zhu</a>, Dr. <a href="https://ziyi-yang.github.io/" style="color: rgb(203, 157, 255);">Ziyi Yang</a>, and Professor <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/" style="color: rgb(203, 157, 255);">Rada Mihalcea</a>. If you have any interests in collaborating with me, please drop me an email.

I will be supervising Part II, Part III, and MPhil projects for students currently in Cambridge.
If you are interested in working with me, please feel free to contact me with your **CV** and **transcript**.

Broadly speaking, I am interested in Natural Language Processing (NLP). My specific research interests include Automatic Fact-Checking, Text Summarisation (particularly controllable text summarisation and dialogue summarisation), and Large Language Models (especially evaluating hallucination in LLMs and improving their factuality). Note that I will not supervise projects outside the scope of NLP/AI, but I am open to interdisciplinary projects such as AI for Science (AI4Science) and NLP for Education (NLP4Education).

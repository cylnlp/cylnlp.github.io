I will be supervising Part II, Part III, and MPhil projects for students currently in Cambridge.
Research of my interests include: **Text Summarisation** (in particular **Controllable Text Summarisation** and **Dialogue Summarization**), **Evaluation**, **Large Language Models** (in particular evaluating hallucination in LLMs or improving the factuality).
<!-- Students are encouraged to reach out to me for discussions on their project concepts. My expertise lies in diverse areas within Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), including Human-AI interaction, Adaptive UI, Human-Robot Interaction, Games, as well as Virtual Reality (VR)/Mixed Reality (MR) and Sensing Technologies for Ubiquitous Computing. -->

I will be supervising Part II, Part III, and MPhil projects for students currently in Cambridge.
Research of my interests include: **Automatic Fact-Checking**, **Text Summarisation** (in particular **Controllable Text Summarisation** and **Dialogue Summarization**), and **Large Language Models** (in particular evaluating hallucination in LLMs or improving the factuality).
If you are interested in the above topic, please feel free to contact me with your **CV** and **transcript**.
